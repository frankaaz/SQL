-In this project, I'm going to work with a dataset called "chinook", which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers-

-Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS FullName, CustomerID, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> "USA";

-Show only the Customers from Brazil-
SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS FullName, CustomerID, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

-Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customers full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country-
SELECT c.FirstName || ' ' || c.LastName AS FullName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE i.BillingCountry = "Brazil"
ORDER BY FullName;

-Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT e.EmployeeId, e.LastName, e.FirstName, e.Title, c.SupportRepId
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
GROUP BY c.SupportRepId

-Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.


-Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agents full name.


-Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.


-How many Invoices were there in 2009?


-What are the total sales for 2009?


-Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.


-Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.


-Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.


-Show the total sales made by each sales agent.


-Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
