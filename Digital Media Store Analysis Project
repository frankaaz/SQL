-In this project, I'm going to work with a dataset called "chinook", which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers-

-Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS FullName, CustomerID, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> "USA";

-Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS FullName, CustomerID, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

-Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customers full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT c.FirstName || ' ' || c.LastName AS FullName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE i.BillingCountry = "Brazil"
ORDER BY FullName;

-Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent"

-Show Employees who also have a SupportRepId.
SELECT e.EmployeeId, e.LastName, e.FirstName, e.Title, c.SupportRepId
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
GROUP BY c.SupportRepId

-Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM invoices

-Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agents full name.

WITH invoice_customer AS (
    SELECT i.InvoiceId, i.CustomerId, c.SupportRepId
    FROM invoices i
    LEFT JOIN customers c ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
    ORDER BY c.SupportRepId
)
    
SELECT invoice_customer.InvoiceId, invoice_customer.CustomerId, e.EmployeeId, e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS FullName, e.Title
FROM invoice_customer
JOIN employees e ON invoice_customer.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId

-Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
WITH invoice_customers AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM invoices i
    LEFT JOIN customers c ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
)

SELECT invoice_customers.Total AS InvoiceTotal, invoice_customers.FirstName || ' ' || invoice_customers.LastName AS FullName ,invoice_customers.Country, e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS SalesAgentName
FROM invoice_customers
JOIN employees e ON invoice_customers.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId

-How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceDate) AS CountInvoices2009
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'

-What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total), 2) AS TotalSales2009
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'

-Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT i.InvoiceLineId, i.TrackId, t.Name
FROM invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN tracks t ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId
ORDER BY i.InvoiceLineId

-Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ii.InvoiceLineId, t.Name AS Track, ar.Name AS Artist
FROM invoice_items ii
JOIN tracks t ON ii.TrackId = t.TrackId
JOIN albums al ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId
JOIN artists ar ON al.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId
ORDER BY ii.InvoiceLineId

-Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.TrackId, t.Name AS Track, al.Title AS Album, mt.Name AS MediaType, g.Name AS Genre
FROM tracks t
JOIN albums al ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId
JOIN media_types mt ON t.MediaTypeId = mt.MediaTypeId
JOIN genres g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId

-Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.EmployeeId, e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS SalesAgentName, ROUND(SUM(Total), 2) AS TotalSales
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId

-Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS SalesAgentName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) AS TotalSales2009
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE i.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId
ORDER BY TotalSales2009 DESC
LIMIT 1
