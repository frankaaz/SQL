#In this project, I'm querying and analyzing a database with multiple tables in it to obtain statistics about customer and order data.

#1. Overview of the January Sales.
SELECT *
FROM "JanSales"

#2. Amount of orders that were placed in January.
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM "JanSales"
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Orders that were specifically for an iPhone.
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM "JanSales"
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Show the account numbers for all the orders paced in February.
--1st, overview of February sales--
SELECT *
FROM "FebSales";

--2nd, Join statement to determine the account numbers with orders in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM "customers"
INNER JOIN "FebSales"
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#5. Show the cheapest product sold in January and its price.
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM "JanSales"
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#6. Show the revenue of each product (revenue as total quantity times price).
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity), price, sum(Quantity)*price AS revenue
From "JanSales"
WHERE Product <> ''
AND Product <> 'Product'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. Show the products sold at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, quantity sold, and revenue.
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity), price, sum(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM "FebSales"
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#8. Show how many customers ordered more than 2 products, and the average amount spent for all of them.
SELECT count(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), avg(Feb.quantity*Feb.price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(FEB.orderid) = 6
AND Feb.orderid <> 'Order ID'

#9. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate like '02/%'
AND location like '%Los Angeles%'
